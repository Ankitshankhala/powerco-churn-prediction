# PowerCo Churn Prediction – BCG X Simulation

This project is part of the BCG X Data Science Job Simulation on Forage. It focuses on identifying key drivers of customer churn for PowerCo, a utility provider, and building a predictive model to flag at-risk SME clients.

##  Problem Statement
PowerCo was facing rising churn in a competitive market. The objective was to determine whether pricing patterns and customer behavior could help predict churn, enabling proactive retention.

##  Project Workflow
- Business understanding & hypothesis framing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature engineering (price sensitivity, contract dynamics)
- Predictive modeling using Random Forest (scikit-learn)
- Evaluation using Accuracy, Recall, ROC AUC
- Executive summary with business recommendations

Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Seaborn, Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook

Results
- Accuracy: 87%
- ROC AUC: 0.85
- Key predictors: Net Margin, Consumption, Tenure
- Churn reduction potential: 15–20%

Files Included
- `notebooks/` – EDA, feature engineering, and model training
- `data/` – Cleaned datasets used in the simulation
- `results/` – Final predictions
- `executive_summary.pdf` – Client-ready abstract slide
